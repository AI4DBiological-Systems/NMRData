# NMRData

This is a mini-data repository for research and development work on 1D 1H NMR spectrum simulation and quantification algorithms. The principal investigators on our quantitative NMR research team are: Miroslava Čuperlović-Culf at the National Research Council of Canada (NRC) and David A. Campbell at Carleton University.

The authors of this repository would like to express gratitude to the National Research Council of Canada for providing sample experiments, and making them publicly available. NMR quantification and simulation is a difficult problem, and we encourage other groups to offer their own experiments for public use.

Please reach out to our principal investigators if you would like to contribute your own experiments to this repository.

### Contents
Some experiments from BMRB seems to be taken by the same machine, and are grouped as subfolders in the `BMRB\similar_settings` folder.

Some experiments are kindly provided by the National Research Council of Canada. They are in the `NRC` folder.

The experiments used by the GISSMO database were acquired by the GISSMO team, or from existing BMRB database entries. Results from the GISSMO work are used in our work. For reference, the GISSMO experiment data and our extracted information (stored in JLD files) are located in the `input` folder.
